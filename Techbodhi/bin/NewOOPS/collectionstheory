Collections
List (I)    Set (I)  == Interfaces
Arraylist Linkedlist vector  === classes

Set (I)
Hashset  LinkedHashset  Treeset  === classes 

Collections are used for dynamic data - grow / shrinking
object is a superclass of all the classes where the muliple datatypes in array can be stored 

public static void main(String[] args)
{int a =10;
String name = "Anand";
boolean flag = true;

object[] str = new Object[3];
str[0]=a;
str[1]=name;
str[2]=flag;
}

Difference between List and Set
List has duplicate values
Set has unique values

Array list is used for data extraction ; array list 
Linked list is used for adding and removing of data ; doubly data structures 
Above 2 are not threadsafe and non synchronised 
Vector is threadsafe / synchronised  ; legacy class 

== difference between arraylist and vector 
in vector it grows by 100% 
arraylist grows by 50% 
more reliable is arraylist
